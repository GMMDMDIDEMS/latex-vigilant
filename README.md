# latex-vigilant

The repository's goal is to provide an easily accessible tool that assists LaTeX document writers 
in identifying common (formatting) mistakes. This helps in preventing frustrating formatting errors, allowing 
proofreaders to concentrate more on the content itself. As a result, the tool aims to enhance the
overall quality of the documents produced.
